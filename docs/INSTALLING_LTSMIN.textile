.h1 Installing LTSmin on a Debian Lenny box.

.h2 Required packages:

The following debian packages are required; If you are running a mix of stable/squeeze, this **will** break.

* build-essential
* autoconf (for updating the configure file)
* libtool (for configure)
* libpopt0 libpopt-dev
* zlib1g zlib1g-dev
* xmlto asciidoc

.h2 Dependencies

LTSmin requires some dependencies to be usefull; MCRL2 was suggested, and MCRL was trivial to install (and required for the MPI benchmarks).

.h3 building the dependencies

Since both MCRL and MCRL2 are research projects, they are not available in debian packages. You need to build them yourself.

Get MCRL 2.18.5 from [Their website:http://homepages.cwi.nl/~mcrl/mutool.html] and download mcrl2-200901 (no more recent version; Those are broken) from the [mcrl2 website:http://www.mcrl2.org/mcrl2/wiki/index.php/Home]

.h5 Building mcrl2

Mcrl2 is trivial to install.
<pre>
tar -jxf mcrl2-200901-src.tar.bz2
cd mcrl2/
./configure --prefix=[mcrl2 prefix directory]
make
make install
</pre>

.h5 Building mcrl

Mcrl is similarly trivial to install.
<pre>
tar -zxf mcrl-2.18.5.tar.gz
cd mcrl-2.18.5/
./configure --prefix=[mcrl prefix]
make install
</pre>

.h2 Configuring LTSmin

Now you can configure ltsmin. Remember to plug in the path prefixes for mcrl and mcrl2.
<pre>
./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --prefix /home/ties/bin/ltsmin --with-mcrl2=/home/ties/bin/mcrl2/ --with-mcrl=/home/ties/bin/mcrl-2.18.5/
</pre>
