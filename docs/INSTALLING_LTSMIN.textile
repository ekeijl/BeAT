h1. Installing LTSmin on a Debian box.

This tutorial should enable you to install LTSmin on a debian (lenny/squeeze) box. The install is from git, since the snapshot tarballs on the "ltsmin website":http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/tools/ltsmin/ are **missing** the essential depedencies nipsvm and buddy.

If you end up with errors like the following:
<pre>Making all in nips-vm
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/ties/downloads/ltsmin/nips-vm'
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `all'.  Stop.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/ties/downloads/ltsmin/nips-vm'
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1</pre>

You need to build from the git repository. **The snapshot tarballs are useless unless you want to manually compile nips-vm and buddy!**

h2. The git clone

Clone the git repository and get the submodules
<pre>git clone http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/tools/scm/ltsmin.git
cd ltsmin && git submodule update --init</pre>

h2. Required packages:

The following debian packages are required; If you are running a mix of stable/squeeze, this **will** break.

* build-essential
* autoconf (for updating the configure file)
* libtool (for configure)
* libpopt0 libpopt-dev
* zlib1g zlib1g-dev
* xmlto asciidoc

h2. Dependencies

LTSmin requires some dependencies to be useful. MCRL2 was suggested, and MCRL was trivial to install (and required for the MPI benchmarks).

h3. building the dependencies

Since both MCRL and MCRL2 are research projects, they are not available in debian packages. You need to build them yourself.

Get MCRL 2.18.5 from "their website":http://homepages.cwi.nl/~mcrl/mutool.html and download mcrl2-200901 (not a more recent version; Those are broken) from the "mcrl2 website":http://www.mcrl2.org/mcrl2/wiki/index.php/Home

h5. Building mcrl2

Mcrl2 is trivial to install.
<pre>tar -jxf mcrl2-200901-src.tar.bz2cd mcrl2/
./configure --prefix=[mcrl2 prefix directory]
make
make install</pre>

h5. Building mcrl

Mcrl is similarly trivial to install.
<pre>tar -zxf mcrl-2.18.5.tar.gz
cd mcrl-2.18.5/
./configure --prefix=[mcrl prefix]
make install</pre>

h2. Configuring LTSmin

Now you can configure ltsmin. Remember to plug in the path prefixes for mcrl and mcrl2.

<pre>./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --prefix /home/ties/bin/ltsmin --with-mcrl2=[mcrl2 prefix] --with-mcrl=[mcrl prefix]</pre>
